Description: In this project we created our own multicontroller concurrent software application uisng Beaglebone Green and Tiva Development Board TM4c1294. We used sensors like MQ7 gas sensor, ky026 Flame sensor and Si7021 sensor and connected them to the Tiva board, we also collected data from these sensors and logged them. We also control these devices through the Beaglebone green.
